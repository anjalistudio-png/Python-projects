# Python-projects
This repository is a collection of simple Python scripts designed to help beginners learn core programming concepts. Each project is a small, self-contained program that demonstrates different aspects of the Python language, including user input, loops, conditionals, and using external libraries.
Projects Included
Caesar Cipher (ceaserEncrypt.py) 🔒
A classic encryption and decryption tool. This script uses a simple substitution cipher to shift letters in a message by a given key. It's a great example of string manipulation and modular arithmetic.

Dice Roll Simulator (diceroll.py) 🎲
A straightforward program that simulates rolling a pair of six-sided dice. It's an excellent way to learn about the random module, while loops, and f-strings for formatted output.

Basic Keylogger (Keylogger.py) ⌨️
(For Educational Purposes Only)
This script demonstrates how to create a basic keylogger using the pynput library. It logs keystrokes to a file on your desktop. This project is meant for understanding how to interact with hardware and handle event listeners.

Rock, Paper, Scissors (rps.py) 🪨📄✂️
A classic command-line game against the computer. This project teaches you about conditional logic (if/elif/else), the random.choice() method, and handling user input.

Guess the Number (guess_the_number.py) 🔢
A simple number-guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number. This program is a perfect example of using while loops, try-except blocks for error handling, and logical comparisons.
